        Hi, my name is Laura Salomon. I'm 27 years old and I've lived in Tucson my whole life. I have a lot of family that I love, so I always enjoy being around them and my friends too. One of the biggest parts of who I am stems from my love of the water. I started swimming competitively at a very young age so I have always been around the pool. I have been on year round swim teams since I was small and all the way up past high school. Swimming has even lead me to one of my most memorable trips across the world. In middle school I was picked to represent Arizona and be a part of a USA team. We traveled to Australia, where we trained and then competed in a swim meet against the other countries. The experience that I had there was one of a kind. Being a swimmer has brought me to many different things and people. I've met amazing and talented people such as Amanda Beard (my hero), Michael Phelps, Conor Dwyer, and more. Because of swimming, I have the job that I currently have now. I started out as a Lifeguard, then got certified to teach swim lessons, now I am currently a Lifeguard Instructor and Pool Supervisor. I have been guarding and supervising for a long time but it is time to switch it up.

        One of my other passions that I enjoyed doing was art and designing things. I love anything that allows me to create. I used to do alot of graphic design type of projects for friends and family. I've done t-shirts, business cards, flyers, etc. I would do it for fun and I thought about going in to that type of work for a living but changed my mind. I decided to go down the health profession path. I took alot of classes that would get me closer to a nursing or radiology tech degree. I wasn't happy with what I was doing so I stopped going to school. I have been doing the same thing for a while and so I've been thirsting for the answer of what I really want to do for the long term. I had a discussion with a friend that landed on the topic of web development. After alot of thought and research, I decided to make some moves and go for it. That decision has led me to what I am doing now, which is going through the UofA Web Development Boot Camp. If I stick with this challenging but mentally stimulating path then I know that I will constantly be learning and growing.

        On a lighter note, the other things I enjoy doing for fun is pretty much anything. I like staying active but I do love my lazy days also. I have a deep love for movies and tv shows. I can quote stuff all day. I also love going to shows and concerts. Attending those has also allowed me to meet and even become friends with some interesting and talanted people. Comedy and music takes me to my happy place. I love to go places that I've never been before or do things that I've never done, wherever and whenever. I am down for anything that's thrilling, that will give me great memories, or a good laugh!

        There is always more to know but that somewhat sums me up.
